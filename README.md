# Simple Animated Sprite Script with SDL2 in C

This repository contains a simple animated sprite script written in C using SDL2. The script loads a sprite sheet and displays it on the screen. The script loops through the frames of animation to create a simple animation effect.

See my C_Bomberman repository for an example of how to use this script.
